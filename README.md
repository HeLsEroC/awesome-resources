| [Superintelligence (AI/Ethics)](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12202/26642) | Superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of thebrightest and most gifted human minds. In light of recent advances in machine intelligence, a num-ber of scientists, philosophers and technologists have revived the discussion about the potentiallycatastrophic risks entailed by such an entity.  In this article, we trace the origins and developmentof the neo-fear of superintelligence, and some of the major proposals for its containment. We arguethat total containment is, in principle, impossible, due to fundamental limits inherent to comput-ing itself. Assuming that a superintelligence will contain a program that includes all the programsthat can be executed by a universal Turing machine on input potentially as complex as the state ofthe world, strict containment requires simulations of such a program, something theoretically (andpractically) impossible. |
| [AI Robotics + Theory of mind](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77918-x?utm_source=red&utm_medium=nl&utm_campaign=ada&utm_content=2021117) | Behavior modeling is an essential cognitive ability that underlies many aspects of human and animal social behavior (Watson in Psychol Rev 20:158, 1913), and an ability we would like to endow robots. Most studies of machine behavior modelling, however, rely on symbolic or selected parametric sensory inputs and built-in knowledge relevant to a given task. Here, we propose that an observer can model the behavior of an actor through visual processing alone, without any prior symbolic information and assumptions about relevant inputs. To test this hypothesis, we designed a non-verbal non-symbolic robotic experiment in which an observer must visualize future plans of an actor robot, based only on an image depicting the initial scene of the actor robot. We found that an AI-observer is able to visualize the future plans of the actor with 98.5% success across four different activities, even when the activity is not known a-priori. We hypothesize that such visual behavior modeling is an essential cognitive ability that will allow machines to understand and coordinate with surrounding agents, while sidestepping the notorious symbol grounding problem. Through a false-belief test, we suggest that this approach may be a precursor to Theory of Mind, one of the distinguishing hallmarks of primate social cognition. |
| [Natural language predicts viral escape, NLP](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/284?utm_source=red&utm_medium=nl&utm_campaign=ada&utm_content=2021117) | Natural language predicts viral escape Viral mutations that evade neutralizing antibodies, an occurrence known as viral escape, can occur and may impede the development of vaccines. To predict which mutations may lead to viral escape, Hie et al. used a machine learning technique for natural language processing with two components: grammar (or syntax) and meaning (or semantics) (see the Perspective by Kim and Przytycka). Three different unsupervised language models were constructed for influenza A hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein. Semantic landscapes for these viruses predicted viral escape mutations that produce sequences that are syntactically and/or grammatically correct but effectively different in semantics and thus able to evade the immune system. |

| [Model Evaluation](https://www.notion.so/Model-Evaluation-97bfa579b9684733b1b3b52c449daedc) | When measuring model performance, we want to have sensible metrics that indicate how well the model is performing. This should encompass the model's ability to predict each of the training classes and give us insight into any biases that may exist on the model. By having these clear metrics, we can get a good idea of how the model will perform when deployed into production, which will ultimately drive performance of the product and its impact in the market. |
| [precision and recall](https://kavita-ganesan.com/how-to-compute-precision-and-recall-for-a-multi-class-classification-problem/#.YEy3iZ1KhPa) | In evaluating multi-class classification problems, we often think that the only way to evaluate performance is by computing the accuracy which is the proportion or percentage of correctly predicted labels over all predictions. |
| [Overview of Modelling](https://www.notion.so/Overview-of-Modelling-924b54c3c169402688404d34d823ec8e) | As a product manager looking to develop AI products, it is important to understand the mechanics of ML. Model architecture, training data and model evaluation are all key elements of ML and are instrumental in successful AI product management. When using AI and products, there are numerous uncertainties that that can alter the course of development and by understand the core concepts, we can stay ahead of the unknowns and plan development accordingly. |
| [Multi-Class Metrics Made Simple, Part I: Precision and Recall](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-metrics-made-simple-part-i-precision-and-recall-9250280bddc2) | Performance measures for precision and recall in multi-class classification can be a little — or very — confusing, so in this post I’ll explain how precision and recall are used and how they are calculated. It’s actually quite simple! But first, let’s start with a quick recap of precision and recall for binary classification. |

| [Calculate Precision, Recall, and F-Measure for Imbalanced Classification](https://machinelearningmastery.com/precision-recall-and-f-measure-for-imbalanced-classification/) | Classification accuracy is the total number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions made for a dataset. As a performance measure, accuracy is inappropriate for imbalanced classification problems. |
| [4 Types of Classification Tasks in Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/) | Machine learning is a field of study and is concerned with algorithms that learn from examples. Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.” |
| [User Persona Examples](https://venngage.com/blog/user-persona-examples/) | Promoting a product without knowing who your target audience–or what your target audience wants–is an impossible task. You’ll just be making decisions based on what you think they want. That’s not sustainable over the life of any brand. That’s why creating user personas is important for any company that wants to grow. |

| [Machine Learning, Architectural Styles and Property Values](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335946520_Machine_Learning_Architectural_Styles_and_Property_Values) | This paper first introduces an algorithm that collects pictures of individual buildings from Google Street View. Second, it trains a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify residential buildings into architectural styles, taking into account spatial dependencies of these styles. Third, it investigates whether architectural styles influence house prices. For resales , the architectural style is a significant determinant of transaction prices while no such effect is found for new buildings. Additionally, we are able to provide guidance on how to detect and overcome some of the limitations of machine learning methods through a large-scale comparison of predictions and expert classifications. |
